—every morning, check for active stocks, and return a list of 2-5 which fit my indicators

—day trade them to make money

*--need to have an open websocket for real time data

—log every trade

—after each time the script runs, compare logs to past logs, and return an effectiveness rating of the strategy

—I want to be sent notifications when:
	—I make money on a trade
	—the strategy is updated
	—at the end of the week with numbers on how effective it was


Trade Bot

-host on Digital Ocean Droplet - $6/month max

*change made for test 2

***
--CI/CD pipeline so that when code is pushed to github, it updates the droplet
	-generate a public/private key locally, add them to github (DONE)	
		*github needs local deploy keys, they were generated with this command:
		ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@tradebot -f ~/deploy_key 
			path: users/andrewlederman/deploy_key (private) and deploy_key.pub (public)
			*the private key should be stored in github secrets(DONE), and the public key
			should be stored in the droplet. So we know where to go, and the private key
			gives github access to the droplet.
	-write a github action that will SSH into the droplet and update the code with rsync	
	
--to create the droplet, I use an SSH key I generated to connect to it. To do this,
you run ssh-keygen on your computer. It generates a private and public key locally. You
paste the pub key into the droplet, and it can then connect to your local machine where
the private key lives.

*the droplet IPv4 is: 137.184.190.88
