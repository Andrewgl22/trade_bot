--CI/CD pipeline so that when code is pushed to github, it updates the droplet



	-generate a public/private key locally, add them to github (DONE)	
		*github needs local deploy keys, they were generated with this command:
		ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@tradebot -f ~/deploy_key 
			path: users/andrewlederman/deploy_key (private) and deploy_key.pub (public)
			*the private key should be stored in github secrets(DONE), and the public key
			should be stored in the droplet. So we know where to go, and the private key
			gives github access to the droplet.
	-write a github action that will SSH into the droplet and update the code with rsync	
	
--to create the droplet, I use an SSH key I generated to connect to it. To do this,
you run ssh-keygen on your computer. It generates a private and public key locally. You
paste the pub key into the droplet, and it can then connect to your local machine where
the private key lives.

*the droplet IPv4 is: 137.184.190.88

*I made a 2nd set of ssh keys inside .ssh folder on my computer called trade_bot_rsa that
is the one I actually used.

*the private key must include ---BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY and ---END RSA PRIVATE KEY lines
